Over 10 years of experience working in cyber security including penetration testing of enterprise networks and web application, establishing information security programs and ensuring the CIA as well as managing mature information security policies, governance, awareness, vulnerability and risk assessment and remediation.

As an active member of the Cyber Security community, I have proven my skills in ethical hacking by identifying and responsibly disclosing security bugs: remote code execution on Stanford, HackTheBox, New York University and Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (Massachusetts General Hospital), web admin on Cambridge and MIT universities; McAfee antivirus bypass.

Knowledge of Bash Scripting, PHP, SQL, Python and C-based program languages allows me to create my own applications for automation and optimization companyâ€™s security. Fast Google Dorks Scan, AutoSUID and Domain checker are some of my applications, which are widely recognized by big vendors like Splunk, Hakin9 and KitPloit.

In addition to my bug bounty and application development skills, I stay up to date with the latest industry standards and best practices by continuously pursuing professional education and certification. I hold several certifications such as the Certified Chief Information Security Officer (CCISO), EC-Council Information Security Manager (EISM), Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), Certified Ethical Hacker (Master), and Certified Network Defense Architect (CNDA).

***As an information security expert, my goal is to improve security by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing effective solutions.***
