### Hi there, I'm Ivan Glinkin - Cyber Security Analyst 👋
![](https://www.ivanglinkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sign.png)

8+ years combined operational work experience in penetration tests of enterprise networks and web application, physical social engineering and escalating the privileges.

As a member of the Enterprise Security and Risk Team, I conduct enterprise wide security risk assessments by infiltrating its systems and breach its physical perimeters. This highlights gaps in the organization’s technical security that require fixing as well as being involved in executing the security awareness plan.

Knowledge of Bash Scripting, PHP, SQL, Python and C-based program languages allows me to create my own applications for automation and optimization company’s security.

Passed both the CEH knowledge-based MCQ and the CEH Practical exam on 92,8% and 90% respectively allowed me to become the TOP 10 in the World Global Ethical Hacking LeaderBoard!

I am the offensive security and my goal does not end at gaining full access – that is only a starting point.
